      Abstract: Within the context of the ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards for point-of-care (POC) medical
      device communication (MCD), this standard provides the nomenclature that supports both the domain infor-
      mation model and service model components of the standards family, as well as the semantic content
      exchanged with medical devices. The nomenclature is specialized for patient vital signs information represen-
      tation and medical device informatics, with major areas including concepts for electrocardiograph (ECG),
      haemodynamics, respiration, blood gas, urine, fluid-related metrics, and neurology, as well as specialized
      units of measurement, general device events, alarms, and body sites. The standard defines both the architec-
      ture and major components of the nomenclature, along with extensive definitions for each conceptual area.

      Keywords: codes, information model, medical device communication, nomenclature, ontology, patient,
      point-of-care, POC, semantics, service model, terminology

      IEEE Standards documents are developed within the IEEE Societies and the Standards Coordinating Committees of the
      IEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA) Standards Board. The IEEE develops its standards through a consensus develop-
      ment process, approved by the American National Standards Institute, which brings together volunteers representing varied
      viewpoints and interests to achieve the final product. Volunteers are not necessarily members of the Institute and serve with-
      out compensation. While the IEEE administers the process and establishes rules to promote fairness in the consensus devel-
      opment process, the IEEE does not independently evaluate, test, or verify the accuracy of any of the information contained
      in its standards.

      Use of an IEEE Standard is wholly voluntary. The IEEE disclaims liability for any personal injury, property or other dam-
      age, of any nature whatsoever, whether special, indirect, consequential, or compensatory, directly or indirectly resulting
      from the publication, use of, or reliance upon this, or any other IEEE Standard document.

      The IEEE does not warrant or represent the accuracy or content of the material contained herein, and expressly disclaims
      any express or implied warranty, including any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a specific purpose, or that
      the use of the material contained herein is free from patent infringement. IEEE Standards documents are supplied “AS IS.”

      The existence of an IEEE Standard does not imply that there are no other ways to produce, test, measure, purchase, market,
      or provide other goods and services related to the scope of the IEEE Standard. Furthermore, the viewpoint expressed at the
      time a standard is approved and issued is subject to change brought about through developments in the state of the art and
      comments received from users of the standard. Every IEEE Standard is subjected to review at least every five years for revi-
      sion or reaffirmation. When a document is more than five years old and has not been reaffirmed, it is reasonable to conclude
      that its contents, although still of some value, do not wholly reflect the present state of the art. Users are cautioned to check
      to determine that they have the latest edition of any IEEE Standard.

      In publishing and making this document available, the IEEE is not suggesting or rendering professional or other services
      for, or on behalf of, any person or entity. Nor is the IEEE undertaking to perform any duty owed by any other person or
      entity to another. Any person utilizing this, and any other IEEE Standards document, should rely upon the advice of a com-
      petent professional in determining the exercise of reasonable care in any given circumstances.

      Interpretations: Occasionally questions may arise regarding the meaning of portions of standards as they relate to specific
      applications. When the need for interpretations is brought to the attention of IEEE, the Institute will initiate action to prepare
      appropriate responses. Since IEEE Standards represent a consensus of concerned interests, it is important to ensure that any
      interpretation has also received the concurrence of a balance of interests. For this reason, IEEE and the members of its soci-
      eties and Standards Coordinating Committees are not able to provide an instant response to interpretation requests except in
      those cases where the matter has previously received formal consideration. At lectures, symposia, seminars, or educational
      courses, an individual presenting information on IEEE standards shall make it clear that his or her views should be considered
      the personal views of that individual rather than the formal position, explanation, or interpretation of the IEEE.

      Comments for revision of IEEE Standards are welcome from any interested party, regardless of membership affiliation with
      IEEE. Suggestions for changes in documents should be in the form of a proposed change of text, together with appropriate
      supporting comments. Comments on standards and requests for interpretations should be addressed to:
                                      Secretary, IEEE-SA Standards Board

            NOTE — Attention is called to the possibility that implementation of this standard may require use of subject
            matter covered by patent rights. By publication of this standard, no position is taken with respect to the exist-
            ence or validity of any patent rights in connection therewith. The IEEE shall not be responsible for identifying
            patents for which a license may be required by an IEEE standard or for conducting inquiries into the legal valid-
            ity or scope of those patents that are brought to its attention.

      Authorization to photocopy portions of any individual standard for internal or personal use is granted by the Institute of
      Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., provided that the appropriate fee is paid to Copyright Clearance Center. To

      ISO Foreword
      ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards
      bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through
      ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has
      been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations,
      governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates
      closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical
      standardization.

      Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for
      voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75% of the member bodies
      casting a vote.

      A pilot project between ISO and the IEEE has been formed to develop and maintain a group of ISO/IEEE
      standards in the field of medical devices as approved by Council resolution 43/2000. Under this pilot
      project, IEEE is responsible for the development and maintenance of these standards with participation and
      input from ISO member bodies.

      Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this International Standard may be the
      subject of patent rights. Neither ISO nor the IEEE shall be held responsible for identifying any or all such
      patent rights.

      IEEE Introduction

      This introduction is not part of ISO/IEEE 11073-10101:2004(E), Health informatics — Point-of-care medical device
      communication — Part 10101: Nomenclature.


      ISO/IEEE 11073 standards enable communication between medical devices and external computer systems.
      They provide automatic and detailed electronic data capture of patient vital signs information and device
      operational data. The primary goals are to:

          —    Provide real-time plug-and-play interoperability for patient-connected medical devices

          —    Facilitate the efficient exchange of vital signs and medical device data, acquired at the point-of-care,
               in all health care environments


      “Real-time” means that data from multiple devices can be retrieved, time correlated, and displayed or
      processed in fractions of a second. “Plug-and-play” means that all the clinician has to do is make the
      connection — the systems automatically detect, configure, and communicate without any other human
      interaction.


      “Efficient exchange of medical device data” means that information that is captured at the point-of-care
      (e.g., patient vital signs data) can be archived, retrieved, and processed by many different types of
      applications without extensive software and equipment support, and without needless loss of information.
      The standards are especially targeted at acute and continuing care devices, such as patient monitors,
      ventilators, infusion pumps, ECG devices, etc. They comprise a family of standards that can be layered
      together to provide connectivity optimized for the specific devices being interfaced.

      Part 10101:
      Nomenclature




      1. Scope

      The scope of this standard is nomenclature architecture for point-of-care (POC) medical device communica-
      tion (MDC). It consists of three parts: the body of the standard, which defines the overall architecture of the
      organization and relationships among nomenclature components; normative Annex A and Annex B, which
      provide specifications of semantics and syntaxes, respectively; and informative Annex C, the bibliography.

      This standard is intended for use within the context of IEEE Std 1073,1 which sets out the relationship
      between this and other documents in the POC MDC series.



      2. Conformance

      There are no particular implementation conformance requirements defined in this standard, but some
      requirements for nomenclature representation are established in this standard to guide specification of
      semantics and syntax in other parts of the overall standard.



      3. Normative references

      The following normative documents contain provisions that, through reference in this text, constitute provi-
      sions of ISO/IEEE 11073-10101. For dated references, subsequent amendments to, or revisions of, any of
      these publications do not apply. However, parties to agreements based on ISO/IEEE 11073-10101 are
      encouraged to investigate the possibility of applying the most recent editions of the normative documents
      indicated below. For undated references, the latest edition of the normative document referred to applies.
      Members of ISO and IEC maintain registers of currently valid international standards.

      6. Application

      Nomenclature in this standard is primarily intended to be used in protocol data units (PDUs) as values of
      fields, typically object-oriented attributes, which specify particular alternatives among a related semantic
      set. The following are the most common field types.
            —     Managed object class ID, e.g., MDS [medical device system], VMS [virtual medical system], VMD
                  [virtual medical device], VMO [virtual medical object], Channel, Metric, Alert, Scanner, SCO [ser-
                  vice and control object], etc.
            —     Event type ID, e.g., a numerical observation type of event report.
            —     Attribute ID: various attributes in the domain information model (DIM)
                  —      Type ID: in general, a concept not covered by a class definition per se, but by a well-known or
                         commonly used type of a class, e.g., a VMD (e.g., ventilator, gas analyzer), Metric object class
                         physiological function code (PFC) (e.g., heart rate, cerebral profusion pressure), or the body
                         site of a measurement (e.g., left toe).
                  —      State: mode, status or finite state machine (FSM) state, e.g., associated.
                  —      Dimension: unit of measurement, e.g., deciliters per hour [dl/h].
                  —      Indication: alarm, e.g., asystole, INOP (e.g., malfunction), or advisory (e.g., check
                         calibration).
            —     Action type ID, e.g., activate.
            —     External nomenclature ID, e.g., Systematized Nomenclature for Medicine (SNOMED).

      Technically, information is initially defined in an abstract syntax, e.g., Abstract Syntax Notation One
      (ASN.1) or medical device data language (MDDL), and then mapped to and interchanged through a transfer
      syntax, e.g., basic encoding rules (BER) or medical device encoding rules (MDER), typically for efficiency
      in the form of integers. However, abstract syntax languages are generally unsuitable for high-precision
      human understanding, especially of medical terms. As a result, both semantic and syntactical definitions are
      needed; as covered in Clause 7 and Clause 8.


      7. Semantics

      Clause 7 establishes specification guidelines. Refer to Annex A for the detailed specification.

      7.2.1 Context-sensitivity

      For processing efficiency, especially bandwidth conservation, some nomenclature codes are defined as
      fixed-length integer 2-tuples, consisting of a code block number and a term code (within the code block).
      Provided that the code block context can be properly mapped, e.g., by implicit syntactical parsing, the pro-
      cessor requires only the term code to correlate the semantic, in which case the term code is context-sensitive
      with respect to the code block, whereas the 2-tuple is context-free.

      For additional processing efficiency, code block numbers and term codes are mapped to 16-bit and 32-bit
      words, as follows.
                [context-free] Nomenclature Code == (Code Block number * 2**16 ) + [context-
                sensitive] Term Code,

      where
        Term Code has the range 2**16 .

      For example, the context-free nomenclature code for a term in code block number 1 whose term code=4100
      is equal to (( 1 * 2**16 ) + 4100) = 65536 + 4100 = 69636 (which uniquely identifies the SpO2 monitor term
      in Table 2).

      Refer to Figure 1 for an illustration of the relationship between code block number and term codes.

      Code interpretation may also be context-sensitive with respect to nomenclature versions; however, nomen-
      clature revision coding is outside of the scope of this standard and should be provided by application PDUs
      during device association.

      7.2.2 Grouping

      Term codes may be grouped into code ranges as follows:
         —      A partition is a group of semantics that are assigned to a contiguous term code range within a code
                block and that have a categorical relationship. For example, object classes, attributes, and notifica-
                tions are partitions of the object-oriented code block. Partitions are prefixed as high-order bit masks
                that are computed by offset, typically in multiples of binary orders of magnitude, e.g., 0x1000,
                0x2000, etc.
                —      Code blocks or partitions may be designated as public and private. Syntactical conformance
                       shall be mandatory for all code blocks and partitions, but semantic conformance for private
                       code blocks or partitions shall not be mandatory. By convention, each code block should allo-
                       cate private partitions consistently; the range 0xF000–0xFFFF is recommended.
         —      A discriminator is a group of related semantics assigned to a contiguous code range that have a reg-
                ular relationship, e.g., maximum/minimum/mean or systolic/diastolic/mean. Discriminators are
                embedded as low-order bit code that are computed by relative offset to a base term.
                For example, Table 1 is an example of a 2-bit device <type> discriminator, in which the relative off-
                sets 0–3 correspond, respectively, with the following semantics:
                —      NOS, offset=0),
                —      MDS class [offset=1],
                —      VMD class [offset=2], and
                —      Channel class [offset=3], respectively.


      8. Syntax

      Nomenclature codes are intended to be mapped to machine-processable forms using various protocols (e.g.,
      ISO/IEEE 11073-20101) and program (e.g., C++) presentation forms. However, because it is impractical to
      do all mappings, this standard shall provide mappings to a set of nominal forms, as follows:
         —      Transfer: numeric form suitable for use in transfer syntaxes; refer to 8.1.
         —      Programmatic: symbolic form suitable for use in programming languages; refer to 8.2.


      8.1 Transfer

      8.1.1 Types

      There are several types of transfer forms:
         a)     Global corresponds with Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) globalForm, i.e., is
                an ISO ASN.1 object identifier (OID). This form is bandwidth-intensive; therefore, complete
                abstract and transfer syntaxes may not be explicitly enumerated.
         b)     Local corresponds with CMIP localForm, i.e., is an unsigned integer. Various canonical forms are
                defined as follows:
                1)    Fixed-length is intended to minimize bandwidth and takes two forms, as follows:
                      i)     Short: a context-sensitive code; refer to 7.2.1. It is intended that the short form be used in
                             real-time or monitoring applications with appropriate association controls, as defined in

                      ii)    Long: a context-free code; refer to 7.2.1. It is intended that this form be used to export
                             nomenclatures through a gateway or persistent medium.
                2)    Variable-length is intended to provide an efficient form for use with fully compliant CMIP-
                      based syntaxes, using BER integers. Short and long forms may be presented analogous with the
                      fixed-length form described in this subclause.

      8.2 Programmatic

      Programmatic, or symbolic, form is intended to be used to develop APIs in a way that applications can reuse
      different implementations with minimum impact on symbol mapping.

      8.2.1 Attribution

      The term code is used as a reference in correlating semantic and syntactical definitions through the use of
      additional attributes, as follows:



     8                                                                                   Copyright © 2004 ISO/IEEE. All rights reserved.

         —      Title, or Reference ID: a symbolic, programmatic form of the term. The form is correlated to the
                context-free code (i.e., titles are by definition context-free with respect to all other titles); all terms
                are prefixed with “MDC_” for consistency.
         —      AutoCode: a numerical value associated with the term. The value is used as an generic identifier; the
                AutoCode is assigned at the time the term is created and remains assigned to that term independent
                of term code revisions. The AutoCode is not normative, but may be used for editorial, indexing pur-
                poses when context-sensitive components (i.e., Code Block and Term Code) are remapped.

      8.2.2 Notation

      While there are many program bases that could be used, the C[++] language is used as a canonical basis in
      this standard.

      Notation conventions for the C[++] programming language are as follows:

                #define           MDC_<TERM>                 <Term Code>            /* <Acronym>             <Auto Code> */

      where
         #define denotes a static assignment, e.g., of the value <c> to the symbol <MDC_term>.
         MDC_<TERM> is the nomenclature symbol (or title); the title is all uppercase.
                —      The prefix MDC_ is used for all terms in this standard.
                —      Partitions may be identified by common prefixes, e.g., _DEV or _LEAD.
                —      Discriminators are identified by regular suffixes, e.g., _MDS, _VMD, or _CHAN; see the
                       example that follows.
         <Term Code> is a decimal number in the range specified during association, e.g., 0–65535 for 16-bit,
                    context-sensitive coding.
         <Acronym> (may be absent) is an abbreviation.
         <Auto Code> is the generic record number of the term.
         The last components are enclosed in the syntax /*  */, which represents a comment.

      For example, the SpO2 Analyzer <types> in Table 2 are represented programmatically as follows:



              #define                    Term Title (or Reference ID)                           Term Code               Auto Code

               #define                   MDC_DEV_ANALY_SAT_O2                                     4104 /*                 2474 */

               #define               MDC_DEV_ANALY_SAT_O2_MDS                                     4105 /*                 4962 */

               #define              MDC_DEV_ANALY_SAT_O2_VMD                                      4106 /*                 5095 */

               #define              MDC_DEV_ANALY_SAT_O2_CHAN                                     4107 /*                 5227 */



      The derived term titles post-fix <null>, _MDS, _VMD, and _CHAN, respectively. The <#define>, <Term
      Title>, and <Term Code> symbols are normative, while the comment </* … */> and the AutoCode
      embedded in it are informative.

      As these term codes are assigned to code block number 1, the context-free nomenclature codes are
      1*65536+[4104 + [0,1,2,3]] Î 69640, …, 69643.

      Terms defined in Annex B shall not be normative unless a semantic corollary is specified in this standard.

      priate to facilitate application programming.

      Annex A
      (normative)

      Nomenclature semantics

      A.1 Overview of nomenclature for vital signs—semantics

      A.1.1 Introduction

      Annex A presents the medical data information base (MDIB), i.e., the set of objects and object instantiations
      occurring in any device of the communicating system as described in the DIM (see ISO/IEEE 11073-
      10201). This common data dictionary is the prerequisite for interoperability of medical devices and device
      systems.

      All subclauses in this annex that correspond to the code blocks in A.2.3 contain explanatory parts to support
      the understanding of this approach in the design of the data dictionary. After these explanations, a code table
      is presented. This structuring is designed to ease and promote maintenance. The authors are well aware that
      despite their strong efforts for completion during development of this standard, application-specific sup-
      plements are to be expected. Comments and proposals for improvement are most welcome.

      Because the number of different object-oriented modelling elements resulting from the DIM is limited, no
      specific nomenclature has been designed for these elements. They are listed in the tables in A.3. Regarding
      the demographics, there are so few that they do not deserve semantic analysis and systematic names. They
      are listed in several tables in A.3.2.9.

      Communication infrastructure is presented in A.4 due to its close relation to the Communication Package of
      the DIM. A set of tables gives the terms and corresponding code values for communication infrastructure
      objects and attributes. Objects in these tables (e.g., the Device Interface object, the MibElement [manage-
      ment information base element] object) and their attributes are not part of the MDIB.

      The nomenclature, i.e., the systematic names, for the terms concerning devices, metrics (measurements and
      enumerations), alerts, etc., is presented in A.5 through A.10.

      For the nomenclature of vital signs devices, for metrics (measurements and enumerations), for body sites,
      for alerts, etc., systematic names have been constructed following the methodology described in the Euro-
      pean standard CEN ENV 12264 [B2]. The systematic name is constructed by means of generative patterns
      and consists of the base concept and two or three descriptors forming with the semantic links the differenti-
      ating criteria. Each differentiating criterion is built by means of a semantic link and an associated category
      (see Clause 7). The constituents of the systematic name are separated by vertical bars. Unused fields are left
      blank and identified by double bars.

      In order to avoid a long list of similar terms, a variable field was employed in some terms. For instance, the
      signal from an electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained from different leads should be identified as ECG | I,
      ECG | II, ECG | III, etc. The corresponding term used in Table A.7.1.2 is ECG <lead> where <lead> stands
      for a general lead that has to be specified according to a separate code table.

      The tables for metrics/enumerations in A.7 are mainly organized according to the target system (e.g., body
      compartment, body part, body function), following some anatomical systematics.

      The tables in A.5 through A.10 show basically six columns: Systematic name, Common term, Acronym,
      Description/Definition, Reference ID, and Code. The common term is the name that is in common use in
      medicine and well-known to medical professionals. The same is true for the acronym except that it refers to
      the corresponding English abbreviations. Description/Definition gives a description, as precise as possible,
      to ensure the correct understanding. It is to be used as basic information for developing the systematic name.


      A.2 Code assignment to the MDIB elements

      A.2.1 Overview

      Before embarking on the development of the vital signs nomenclature, an investigation was made to dis-
      cover whether existing nomenclatures met the needs of POC MDC. A similar investigation had been insti-
      gated by the IEEE 1073 Working Group, and in both cases no appropriate nomenclature had been found. As
      a result, the CEN and IEEE teams collaborated on a vital signs nomenclature and coding system, which
      forms the bulk of this standard.

      This standard is meant to be temporary, in that other efforts to incorporate the terms from this standard into
      a more global medical nomenclature effort may happen, either by incorporating the tables and codes from
      this standard directly into the larger nomenclature (using some referencing scheme to establish context) or
      by simply incorporating the terms and recoding them. In the meantime, the vital signs nomenclature and
      coding system in this standard should be used as a default.


      A.2.2 Basic rules

      The coding of the vital signs nomenclature is based on a number of basic rules:
          a)    The codes should fit within 16 bits in order to minimize the resulting message lengths. Because the
                vital signs nomenclature is used for communication with some very small and cost-constrained
                devices, it was important to try to accommodate their needs to the extent possible and practical.
          b)    As a result of the requirement to keep the codes less than 16 bits, the code space was separated into
                a number of context-sensitive, orthogonal spaces. As a result, the same code can mean different
                things depending on its context, an arrangement that is not appropriate in a more general coding
                effort, but works well in the context of this standard. In the general case, a prefix can be used to dis-
                tinguish between similar codes; however, that practice will tend to double the size of each code.

         c)     Each code space has a block of 4096 entries allocated for private use. The current nomenclature is
                not complete, and in addition, new relevant terms are created all the time. Therefore, space has been
                reserved for private codes that should be used until they are accepted as public and placed into the
                appropriate table.
         d)     Reviewing the coding, one may find tables where the codes increment regularly, while others seem
                to be allocated randomly. These irregularities are generally side effects of how the codes were allo-
                cated and whether historically some term codes had already been allocated (e.g., by the original
                IEEE 1073 working group). In general, the codes are not meant to have any context, and it is danger-
                ous to base implementations on any perceived order or range.
         e)     In some cases, it may seem that codes are missing or were skipped. This situation may be due to the
                following:
                1)    Nomenclature and resulting codes may have been used in early versions of the standard, but
                      were not required in the CEN ENV 13735 [B5] vital signs nomenclature.
                2)    Buffer space may have been allocated for future use.
         f)     In many cases, the codes will jump by a step of 2, 4, etc. This practice is done to account for entries
                that have discriminators, which result in an offset from a base number to fully describe them. The
                use of these discriminators and resulting offsets is described in more detail for each coding space
                (see A.2.3).

      A.2.3 Coding spaces

      As previously mentioned, the coding space is separated into orthogonal independent spaces. Each space can
      use the full 16-bit (65 536 entry) coding space available. The spaces are as follows:
         —      Block A: Object-oriented elements
                         Device nomenclature
         —      Block B:       Units of measurement
         —      Block C:       Metrics
         —      Block D: Body sites
         —      Block E:       Alerts
         —      Block F:       External nomenclatures
         —      Block G: Communication infrastructure
         —      Block H: Reserved for file exchange format (FEF)

      Of these coding spaces, the most densely populated is the metrics space (Block C), which contains many
      physiological measurement instantiations.

      A.3 Data dictionary and codes for object-oriented modeling elements
      (Block A)

      A.3.1 Introduction

      The purpose of this inventory is to provide a schematic presentation and identification scheme for all types
      of object-oriented modeling elements used in the DIM (see ISO/IEEE 11073-10201). These elements build
      up the different parts (subject areas or “packages”) of the DIM that refer to separate application areas.
          a)    The tables in A.3 are ordered following the order of subject areas in the DIM:
                1)    General (or Top object in the DIM)
                2)    Medical Package
                3)    Alert Package
                4)    System Package
                5)    Control Package
                6)    Extended Services Package
                7)    Communication Package
                8)    Archival Package
                9)    Patient Package
                For the communication infrastructure (Block G) objects and attributes that are closely related to the
                Communication Package, but use a different code block (see A.2.3.7), a separate set of tables is pro-
                vided in A.4.
          b)    For each of the subject areas, a set of five separate tables for the different types of object-oriented
                modeling elements used in the DIM is provided:
                1)    Object class items
                2)    Attributes
                3)    Attribute groups
                4)    Behavior (methods)
                5)    Notifications
          c)    In order to enhance readability and usability of the tables, the scheme

                                  Table A.3.x.x—Object-oriented modeling elements:
                                [subject area]—[object-oriented modeling element type]
                is applied strictly in numbering the tables (even accepting that some tables remain empty).
                Thus, to give an example, in Table A.3.9.2. for the Patient Package (subject area 9), the attributes
                (object-oriented modeling element type 2) are given.
          d)    The name of the object-oriented modeling element item as introduced in the DIM appears in the first
                column, DIM name, of each table. The second column, Reference ID, provides equivalent system-
                atic acronyms that allow direct mapping onto the MDIB database, which is also used for ISO/IEEE
                11073 standardization activities in this field. The content of the third column in the object class item
                tables differs from all other tables (see next two paragraphs). The fourth column, Code, contains the
                corresponding codes from this database for each item, as far as exist at publication of this standard.
                For the object class item tables (A.3.*.1), the third column, Derived from, refers to the inheritance
                relation between each item and the object class item from which it is derived. The virtual object
                class item at the top of the inheritance hierarchy is denoted Top.

     PART 10101: NOMENCLATURE                                                                              ISO/IEEE 11073-10101:2004(E)


                For all other tables (A.3.*.2–A.3.*.5), the third column, Belongs to object, indicates the assignment
                of attribute groups, attributes, notifications, or methods to corresponding object class items.

         e)     For structural reasons related to the DIM, attributes or attribute groups are in some cases used with
                different objects that are not derived from each other by inheritance. This situation leads to dupli-
                cated terms that may cause problems when automated queries require unique matches, especially for
                table updates or changes. Therefore, duplicated or multiple terms are generally marked by an aster-
                isk (*). Only the first occurrence of such a term is regarded as a code and reference ID definition and
                is marked by bold letters for the DIM name, the referenced object in the third column, and the code,
                as shown in the following example:

       Start-Time *                            MDC_ATTR_TIME_START                             Metric and derived objects,               2538
                                                                                               Session Archive,
                                                                                               Session Test,
                                                                                               Session Notes


                In addition to the asterisk on the DIM name, all further occurrences of the term explicitly refer to
                this first occurrence (by the expression: ”see: <referenced object>/<subject area>” in the first col-
                umn). The referenced object in the third column again is in bold letters, and the code value is set in
                parentheses (<code>), as shown in the following example:

       Start-Time *                            MDC_ATTR_TIME_START                             Metric and derived objects,             (2538)
       (see: Metric/                                                                           Session Archive,
       Medical Package)                                                                        Session Test,
                                                                                               Session Notes


                This scheme is intended to be appropriate for the work with both the DIM and the MDIB.

     ISO/IEEE 11073-10101:2004(E)            HEALTH INFORMATICS — POINT-OF-CARE MEDICAL DEVICE COMMUNICATION


      A.4 Data dictionary and codes for communication infrastructure (Block G)

      The communication infrastructure tables are closely related to the Communication Package of the DIM.
      Therefore, this clause follows A.3, which discusses the object-oriented modeling elements code block
      (Block A), although that code block (which includes the communication controller object class) and the sep-
      arate communication infrastructure code block (Block G) are not consecutive (see A.2.3).

      Terms and corresponding code values in these tables are used to describe properties of the Device Interface
      (object) for profile identification and model extensions. However, communication infrastructure objects are
      not part of the MDIB. Hence, they are not accessible by communication medical device information service
      element (CMDISE) services, but can be retrieved only by the special Communication Controller object
      method.

      For consistency, the usual scheme introduced in A.3.1 was adopted, resulting in a set of five tables:
                1)     Object class items
                2)     Attributes
                3)     Attribute groups
                4)     Behavior (methods)
                5)     Notifications

      These tables are supplemented by three additional tables:
                6)     Profile support attributes
                7)     Optional package identifiers
                8)     System specification components

      A.5 Nomenclature, data dictionary, and codes for vital signs devices
      (Block A)


      A.5.1 Introduction

      The purpose of the device nomenclature is to support an identification scheme for the Channel, VMD, and
      MDS objects of the DIM.

      The following system provides enough information to support the data from the Metric and Channel objects,
      without replicating this information. For example, in the case of an airway gas analyzer, such a device may
      be measuring one, two, or more gases. The exact gases measured can be divined from the Metric object of
      the DIM that this device will be generating, i.e., O2, CO2, N2O, etc. To include this level of detail in the
      device nomenclature is redundant.

      The nomenclature has been developed so that it would be robust enough to handle the advent of new types of
      medical devices and so that it would be relatively easy to fit such devices within the scheme. As a result, the
      proposal is based around the relatively stable concepts of human organization and physical measurement
      modes. Forming the systematic names is done following the recommendations of the CEN TC251 Project
      Team 015 work that has been referenced (see CEN ENV 12611).

      Each instrument is partitioned into representative subsystems, and each subsystem is associated with the
      human subsystem to which it is applied and with the basic type of measurement or therapy it is applying.
      Attributes are also associated with the VMD and MDS objects and can be found in the DIM.

      NOTE—The device identifications produced by this nomenclature are to be used as an aid for determination of the type
      of device generating the data. However, the nomenclature is not specific enough to guarantee that each name maps to
      one and only one device type.9

      The categorical structure described in CEN ENV 12611 was used to write the rules for systematic names of
      the subset of medical devices useful in the context of this standard (i.e., limited to devices that acquire, inter-
      pret, monitor, or influence vital signs).

      According to requirements from A.1.2 of CEN ENV 12611, five compound base concepts are defined here
      (see A.5.2), as shown in the following example:

            Analyzer: <device> that performs: Analysis

      The <property> measured or affected by the device (considered in general as specification of the <body
      component> in 6.1 of CEN ENV 12611) in the context of the present standard can be made systematically
      explicit and thus will be represented here autonomously in the systematic names (see A.5.3).

      9
          Notes in text, tables, and figures are given for information only, and do not contain requirements needed to implement the standard.

      Finally, three more differentiating criteria were considered suitable for independent representation and pro-
      cessing. Therefore, they are considered as autonomous attributes in the object model, i.e., not as a part of the
      systematic name of the device.

      The two specifications "has specification: <invasiveness>" and "has specification: <continuity>" and the
      criterion "is based in: <technical principle>" are made according to CEN ENV 12611.


      A.5.2 Base concepts

      The target category is device. The different devices applied within the scenarios forming the basis of the
      DIM have different functionality. Accordingly, the following base concepts have been identified:
          —     Analyzer (Analysis) (devices [or the subsystems of more complex devices] that manipulate or inter-
                pret acquired data in order to produce derivative results.)
          —     Calculator (devices [or the subsystems of more complex devices] whose primary function is to per-
                form calculations upon raw or derived data)
          —     Filter (physical particle or chemical filters)
          —     Generator (devices [or the subsystems of more complex devices] that generate physical quantities
                such as heat, moisture, electrical activity, etc.)
          —     Meter (devices [or the subsystems of more complex devices] that perform mensuration or measure-
                ment functions on physical properties such as current, electrical potential, flow, etc.)
          —     Monitor (devices [or the subsystems of more complex devices] that both acquire data and analyze
                it. Such a device is typically composed of a number of virtual devices [VMDs] that perform the
                more basic tasks of data acquisition or data analysis. As an example, a patient multiparameter moni-
                tor would fall into this device class. This descriptor probably includes most real devices.)
          —     Pump (devices [or the subsystems of more complex devices] that transfer a liquid or gas from a
                source or container [to a patient, in the medical device context])
          —     Regulator (devices [or the subsystems of more complex devices] that maintain or control the flow
                or parametric balance of gases, liquids, electrical current, or other physiological analogues)
          —     Stimulator (devices [or the subsystems of more complex devices] that generate physical quantities
                such as heat, moisture, electrical activity, etc.)
          —     System (instruments that consist of transducive, analytical, and therapeutic components. An anes-
                thesia system and most ventilators would fall into this device class.)


      A.5.3 First set of differentiating criteria

      The first semantic link is based on the concept performs (typically afferent functions, particularly measure-
      ment, but also efferent functions such as regulation). The devices are, therefore, classified into a number of
      possible categories based on the functionality they perform.

      A.5.3.1 Semantic link "has measured property: "

      Applicable descriptors include the following:
          —     Concentration
          —     ElectricalPotential
          —     Flow
          —     Multi-Parameter
          —     Negative
          —     Oxy

         —      Pressure
         —      Rate
         —      Resistance
         —      Temperature
         —      Volume


      A.5.4 Second set of differentiating criteria

      Measurements are typically focused or targeted on body subsystems. This category is secondary to function
      because devices typically can measure or effectuate at multiple sites (singly or in parallel). Within each class
      of device, the secondary semantic link refers to the primary body system that the device is monitoring or
      affecting. It was felt that the medical/physiological classification of the human systems has been, and will
      be, a relatively stable concept.

      A.5.4.1 Semantic link "has target:"

      Applicable descriptors include the following:
         —      Airway
         —      Blood
         —      Body
         —      Brain
         —      Gas
         —      Heart
         —      Infusion
         —      Intra-Aorta
         —      Lung
         —      Multi-Gas
         —      Muscle
         —      Physiologic (for devices that are very general and not body-system-specific)
         —      Renal
         —      Resp
         —      Skin/Tissue
         —      Urine


      A.5.5 Third set of differentiating criteria

      Within this standard, there are a number of different contexts for the device nomenclature. The device type
      criterion allows specification using a context-free approach.

      This criterion is represented in Table A.5.1 as <type>, where <type> represents a tuple that can have one of
      four possible values. In other words, each device requires four codes.

      NOTE—This criterion is applicable to each device in Table A.5.1, although in some cases it may not make practical
      sense. For example, one can conceive of a temperature meter MDS, a temperature meter VMD, and a temperature meter
      channel. At the same time, it probably does not make sense to create an anesthesia machine channel, although the
      nomenclature approach does not specifically disallow this option.

      A.5.5.1 Semantic link "device type:"

      Applicable descriptors include the following:
          —     Channel
          —     MDS
          —     Non-Specific
          —     VMD


      A.5.6 Attributes

      In developing the nomenclature, it becomes clear that additional information that is common to most device
      types should be included to better define the device.

      In this case, the attribute relates to the type of technology used by the instrument to make the measurement
      or apply a therapy. Applicable optional attributes of the VMD include the following:
          —     Acoustic
          —     Chemical
          —     Electrical
          —     Impedance
          —     Magnetic
          —     Nuclear
          —     Optical
          —     Thermal

      A.6 Terminology and codes for units of measurement (Block B)

      A.6.1 Introduction

      Clause A.6 presents a simple list (see Table A.6.3) for the coding of units of measurement. The units are pri-
      marily based on CEN ENV 12435 [B3]. Wherever possible, that document has been used to describe units;
      however, in some circumstances, different units are stated primarily because of their common usage in vital
      signs measurement.

      The codes defined in this clause are used in the unit-code attributes of objects defined in the DIM. For per-
      formance reasons, this attribute is not able to represent units of measurement from base units by defining a
      construction formula. The attribute can contain a single code only.

      For describing units of measurements that are not defined in Table A.6.3, the Unspecified term is added to
      the table. If this term is used, the actual unit of measurement must be communicated via a textual attribute
      (i.e., unit-label-string attribute). This attribute allows manufacturers to make use of unusual, unlisted, or
      new measurements that require specific terms not included in the current list. The textual representation of
      the unit of measurement should contain the SI term for the unit, if available.

      Because of current clinical practice, a number of alternative units of measurement are defined in this clause
      that are allowed to represent the same quantity. However, it is strongly encouraged to use the appropriate SI
      units.

      Some nonmetric units are also included (e.g., pound, yard). Although usage of these units is deprecated to
      that of their metric equivalent, they are included in this nomenclature to support devices that do not inter-
      nally support metric units or that do not have the computing capability to make the necessary conversions
      whenever the nonmetric values are communicated. Additionally, a device that is displaying nonmetric units
      to the operator may want to communicate exactly the same representation to minimize the chances of differ-
      ences that could result from making multiple conversions.

      The list is not intended to be exhaustive and will be supplemented over time.


      A.6.2 Orders of magnitude discriminator

      For certain units of measurement outlined in Table A.6.3, it is possible to specify the order of magnitude to
      construct additional more suitable units of measurements.

      In the coding scheme, a code offset can be added to the base code of the unit where this option is explicitly
      allowed in Table A.6.3 as indicated by the notation <magnitude>.

         EXAMPLE: The base code value for meter as defined in Table A.6.3 is 1280. The code offset for milli
         (10–3) as defined in Table A.6.1 is 18. Therefore, the code for millimeter is 1298 (1280 + 18).

      Note that steps of a factor of 1000 are preferred for the order of magnitude discriminators.

      The order of magnitude discriminators are defined in Table A.6.1.

      A.6.3 Units outside of SI

      Certain units of measurement are in such wide use that even though they are not SI units, they are acceptable
      for use in specific applications. For the field of interest, i.e., vital signs, the non-SI units listed in Table A.6.2
      are relevant (a complete listing of the codes is specified in Table A.6.3).


      A.6.4 Units of measurement

      See Table A.6.3 for the units of measurement for vital signs.

      A.7 Nomenclature, data dictionary, and codes for metrics (measurements
      and enumerations) (Block C)

      A.7.1 Nomenclature for ECG measurements

      A.7.1.1 Introduction

      Subclause A.7.1 presents a nomenclature for the systematic names related to ECG measurements. Two types
      of items are presented in Table A.7.1.2. One group of items makes sense as a measurement individually for
      each ECG lead. These items include the ECG lead as a discriminator directly coded in the code, and a site
      attribute is not used. The project team decided for that solution after long discussion because of real-time
      requirements in ECG monitoring applications. Table A.7.1.1 is compatible with the Standard Communica-
      tions Protocol for Computer-Assisted Electrocardiography (SCP-ECG) standard (see CEN EN 1064 [B1])
      and is shown within the first differentiating criteria.

      The second group of items is used without a lead discriminator. Items in this group make sense only as a glo-
      bal measurement, e.g., a measurement that has to be made using several leads or should be the same in all
      leads.

      Nevertheless, the site attribute exists, and Table A.7.1.1 is included in Block D (the body sites codes).10 To
      use the base code only and add the ECG lead in a site attribute is a question of profiling. However, in a mon-
      itoring or real-time situation, codes that include the lead discriminator shall be used. A code space between
      the ECG per-lead measurements and ECG global measurements is reserved for a block of diagnostic mea-
      surements, which may be defined without a lead discriminator and which require a site attribute for leads.

      It may be also possible that such a profile needs more ECG measurements. A code space between the ECG
      per-lead measurements and ECG global measurements is reserved for a block of diagnostic measurements,
      which will be defined without a lead discriminator and which require a site attribute for leads.

      A.7.1.1.1 ECG measurement—examples for different ECG configurations

      Figure A.7.1.1 through Figure A.7.1.6 illustrate the basic ECG signal and specific waveforms that may
      occur during atrial depolarization (P wave), ventricular depolarization (QRS complex), and ventricular repo-
      larization (ST-T wave). The figures depict waveforms that are referred to in ECG books and for which quan-
      tities per ECG lead or from a set of leads are to be determined in computer analysis.

                                                                                             To be measured:

      A.7.1.3 First set of differentiating criteria

      Four semantic links are applied for the first set of differentiating criteria. More than one semantic link and
      one descriptor are possible.

      A.7.1.3.1 Semantic link "has origin:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
          —     ECG (the origin of the measurement is the signal ECG)
          —     ECG <lead> (the origin of the measurement is the signal ECG as obtained with the specific <lead>
                position)

      Table A.7.1.1 lists the ECG <lead> descriptors that are standardized and have been assigned a numerical
      code within the SCP-ECG (see CEN EN 1064 [B1]).

      A.7.2 Nomenclature for ECG enumerations

      A.7.2.1 Introduction

      Table A.7.2.1 holds systematic names concerning ECG diagnostics, derived from ECG signals by an ECG
      machine, an intelligent heart rate monitor, or a physician, who marks his/her diagnostics during visual
      inspection of the signal. These diagnostics are based on specific patterns observed in the physiologic signal.

      A.7.2.2 Base concept

      In this special case, only one descriptor is applicable:
         —      Pattern (the pattern recognized in a measurement)

      A.7.2.3 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field of the systematic name refers to the measurement features.

      A.7.2.3.1 Semantic link "concerns:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Extrasystoles
         —      Rhythm

      A.7.2.3.2 Semantic link "has origin:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Atrial
         —      IntraVentricular
         —      Junctional
         —      Sinus
         —      SupraVentricular
         —      Unknown
         —      Ventricular

      A.7.2.3.3 Semantic link "has diagnostic type:"

      Applicable descriptors for the type of an ECG diagnosis are as follows:
         —      Arrhythmia
         —      Asystoly
         —      AV_Block
         —      Bigeminus
         —      Bradycardia
         —      BundleBranchBlock
         —      ConductionDefect
         —      Contraction
         —      Fibrillation
         —      Flutter
         —      Hypertrophy

      A.7.3 Nomenclature, data dictionary, and codes for haemodynamic monitoring
      measurements

      A.7.3.1 Introduction

      Subclause A.7.3 presents a nomenclature for the systematic names related to haemodynamic measurements.

      A.7.3.2 Base concepts

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Duration (a certain time interval, i.e., the time interval between opening and closing of aortic valve)
         —      Gradient
         —      Index (a mathematical formula with many terms)
         —      Pressure (the pressure of blood in different circulatory compartments and in different time phases
                with respect to the cardiac cycle)
         —      Rate (the frequency of occurrence of events, i.e., of blood pulses)
         —      Resistance (the resistance to the blood flow in different vascular compartments)
         —      Temperature (the temperature of substances)
         —      Volume (the quantity of blood pumped by the heart)
         —      Work (the activity of the heart in pumping blood)

      A.7.3.3 First set of differentiating criteria

      Four semantic links are applied for the first set of differentiating criteria. More than one semantic link and
      one descriptor are possible.

      A.7.3.3.1 Semantic link "is computed as:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Derivative
         —      Difference(SystemicAndPulmonary)
         —      DividedByPressure
         —      MaxNegative
         —      MaxPositive
         —      Mean
         —      MeanDiastolic
         —      MeanSystolic
         —      Relaxation

      A.7.3.3.2 Semantic link "has method:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Continuous
         —      Discontinuous
         —      Invasive
         —      Noninvasive
         —      Plethysmography
         —      Wedge

      A.7.4 Nomenclature, data dictionary, and codes for respiratory measurements

      A.7.4.1 Introduction

      Subclause A.7.4 presents a nomenclature for systematic names in respiratory monitoring. Table A.7.4.1 con-
      tains the systematic names concerning respiration and mechanical ventilation. It is related to the semantic
      link "has target:" in the nomenclature for vital signs devices and the descriptors Airway and Lung (see
      A.5.4.1). All of the tables in A.7.4 contain terms that may be used in attributes in the Metric object of the
      DIM. The acronyms in all the tables are informative and not intended to be normative.

      All measurements related to respiration are included in A.7.4; however, where samples are analyzed in a
      side room or laboratory (e.g., adjacent to an intensive care unit [ICU] or cathlab), they are listed in the
      nomenclature for bedside blood, urine and fluid chemistry in Table A.7.5.1.

      A.7.4.2 Base concepts

      The base concepts for the description of the measurements are physical properties. The following descrip-
      tors are applicable:
         —      Compliance (the elastic properties of the lung)
         —      Concentration (the chemical components of the gas. The gases both delivered to the patient and
                resulting from the patient’s metabolism are described. Derived values are mean values and values at
                distinct time points, e.g., EndtidalCO2)
         —      Duration (a certain time interval, e.g., the inspiration phase)
         —      ElectricalImpedance (an electrical measurement, describing changes in electrical properties of the
                thorax by volume of gas in lungs and fluid volume and distribution in thorax)
         —      Flow (the velocity of the gas exchange, e.g., in the airway)
         —      Index (one of two concepts comprising calculated and derived data. Simple quotients are called
                ratio and complicated calculations, index.)
         —      Mode (the type of respiratory ventilation, i.e., spontaneous and/or mechanically controlled, that is in
                use for the patient)
         —      Number (used for counted events)
         —      Pressure (directly related to physical measurement of pressure)
         —      Rate (the frequency of occurrence of events, etc., based on a certain time frame: second, minute,
                hour, etc.)
         —      Ratio (one of two concepts comprising calculated and derived data. Simple quotients are called
                ratio and complicated calculations, index.)
         —      Resistance (the resistance in the flow of gas in the airway)
         —      Volume (all types of volumes e.g., TidalVolume, MinuteVolume, etc.)

      A.7.4.3 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field of the systematic name in Table A.7.4.1 refers to the measurement features. Six semantic
      links apply for the first set of differentiating criteria; more than one descriptor is possible. They specify dif-
      ferent measurement features, e.g., <kind of property>, <kind of quantity>.

      Descriptors for the method of measurement are as follows:
         —      Dynamic

      A.7.4.4 Second set of differentiating criteria

      The third field of systematic name in Table A.7.4.1 describes the target of measurement. More than one
      descriptor is possible. It holds information about body compartments, body parts, or body functions or refers
      to their state. Because mechanical ventilation is included in the application field, Table A.7.4.1 contains
      terms concerning ventilator functionality as well.

      A.7.4.7 Specification of modes for respirators and ventilators

      Different types of ventilators exist, which use different physical principles in artificial ventilation of the
      lungs, e.g., different types of high-frequency ventilators besides the standard ventilators. Standard ventila-
      tors can be used in different modes also. In Table A.7.4.1, there is an enumeration observation element,
      Mode | | VentilationMode | Ventilator, which can communicate a value of type Bit String denoting the
      ventilation mode in use. Table A.7.4.2 defines these values for the different ventilation modes. Two terms
      are used to describe spontaneous breathing without a ventilator. These values are used with Mode | | Breath-
      ing | Respiration.

      A.7.4.8 Base concept

      The base concept is as follows:
         —      Mode

      A.7.4.9 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field in the systematic name refers to measurement features. Two semantic links apply.

      A.7.4.9.1 Semantic link "has method:"

      Descriptors for the type of breathing or mechanical ventilation are as follows:
         —      AirwayPressureRelease
         —      Biphasic
         —      ExtrathoracicNegativePressure
         —      HighFrequency
         —      HighFrequencyJet
         —      HighFrequencyOscillation
         —      InspiratoryAssist
         —      InverseRatio
         —      Mandatory
         —      MandatoryMinimumVolume
         —      PressureSupport
         —      PositiveEndExpiratoryPressure
         —      PositivePressure
         —      ProportionalAssist
         —      Spontaneous

      A.7.4.9.2 Semantic link "has time criterion:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Continuous (the assistance by external means is continuous in time)
         —      Intermittent (the assistance by external means is discontinuous in time)
         —      Synchronized (the assistance by external means is synchronized to spontaneous breathing)

      A.7.4.10 Second set of differentiating criteria

      The third field in the systematic name describes the target of measurement. Mechanical ventilation and
      spontaneous breathing are described.

      A.7.4.10.1 Semantic link "concerns:"

      Applicable are the following descriptors:
         —      Breathing
         —      Ventilation

      A.7.4.11 Third set of differentiating criteria

      The fourth field holds information about the context. In this case, it is information about the working mode
      of the ventilator itself or spontaneous respiration.

      A.7.4.11.1 Semantic link "has context:"

      The following descriptors are applicable:
         —      Respiration
         —      Ventilator

      A.7.4.12 Bit string table

      See Table A.7.4.2 for the bit strings for ventilator modes.

      A.7.5 Nomenclature, data dictionary, and codes for common blood-gas, blood,
      urine, and other fluid chemistry measurements

      A.7.5.1 Introduction

      Subclause A.7.5 presents additions to the nomenclature scheme for commonly measured biochemical prop-
      erties of blood, urine, and other body fluids. The purpose of the addition of Table A.7.5.1 is to try to encom-
      pass the patient-connected devices within the ICU setting that may measure, in real time, certain blood-gas,
      urinary, or other fluid chemical components. In addition, Table A.7.5.1 may be used for an ICU blood-gas
      analyzer, which connects into an ICU bedside information system. Certain terms may occur in other nomen-
      clature tables, e.g., Table A.7.3.1 (haemodynamic) or Table A.7.6.1 (fluids).

      A.7.5.2 Base concepts

      The base concepts are supposed to represent the more general measurement type. Applicable descriptors are
      as follows:
         —      Concentration (the concentration of chemical components of substances)
         —      Duration (a time duration)
         —      Index (a mathematical formula with many terms)
         —      Osmolality (the osmolality of a component or substance)
         —      Ratio (e.g., specific gravity)

      A.7.5.3 First set of differentiating criteria

      Three semantic links are applied for the first set of differentiating criteria.

      A.7.5.3.1 Semantic link "specific measurement type:"

      The first semantic link represents the more specific measurement type. Applicable descriptors are as
      follows:
         —      BaseExcess (the concentration of a base in blood [unit: millimol per liter])
         —      Coagulation



     150                                                                                 Copyright © 2004 ISO/IEEE. All rights reserved.

         —      Saturation
         —      SpecificGravity
         —      Total

      A.7.5.3.2 Semantic link "specific substance:"

      The second semantic link specifies the substance measured. Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Ca (calcium ion)
         —      Chloride
         —      CoHb (carboxy-haemoglobin)
         —      Glucose
         —      H+ (hydrogen ion)
         —      Hb (haemoglobin)
         —      hCO3 (bicarbonate)
         —      HCT (haematocrit)
         —      K (potassium ion)
         —      MetHb (met-haemoglobin)
         —      Na (sodium ion)
         —      O2Hb (oxy-haemoglobin)
         —      Oxygen
         —      pCO2 (carbon dioxide)
         —      pO2 (oxygen)
         —      Urea

      A.7.5.3.3 Semantic link "is computed as:"

      The third semantic link further specifies how the term is calculated. It is applied to measurements involving
      H+. For example, pH is a logarithmic derivation of the hydrogen ion concentration expressed by linear H+
      (i.e., pH = log10(H+) – 1). Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Linear
         —      Logarithmic

      A.7.5.4 Second set of differentiating criteria

      These criteria represent the particular body compartment, i.e., the fluid type from which the sample was
      taken or where the transducer is located.

      A.7.5.4.1 Semantic link "concerns fluid type:"

      Possible descriptors are the following:
         —      ArterialBlood
         —      Aspirate
         —      CSF (cerebrospinal fluid)
         —      Drainage
         —      Esophageal (fluid)
         —      Gastric (fluid)
         —      General (fluid)

      A.7.6 Nomenclature, data dictionary, and codes for fluid output measurements

      A.7.6.1 Introduction

      Subclause A.7.6 presents a nomenclature for the systematic names for fluid output measurements.

      A.7.6.2 Base concepts

      The base concepts are more or less physical properties. The following descriptors are applicable:
         —      Flow (the flow of fluid into collecting bag, bottle, etc.)
         —      Volume (collected in bag, bottle, etc., or accumulated over a certain time)

      A.7.6.3 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field of the systematic name refers to the measurement features. More than one semantic link
      and one descriptor are possible.

      A.7.6.3.1 Semantic link "has time criterion:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      BalancePeriod (defining that the measurements are accumulated over a certain time period)
         —      Collected (a measurement referring to the volume in the collecting receptacle in use at that moment)
         —      Instantaneous (i.e., the flow measurement is reported as measured in that moment)

      A.7.6.3.2 Semantic link "is computed as"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Difference(Infused, Collected) (i.e., the volume is calculated as a difference of the volume given to
                the patient and the volume collected from the patient)
         —      MeanPreviousHour (i.e., the value is computed as a mean value for the previous hour)

      A.7.6.4 Second set of differentiating criteria

      The third field of the systematic name describes the target of measurement. In this case, parts of the pumping
      system are possible as well as the fluid and drug applied to the patient.

      A.7.6.4.1 Semantic link "concerns:"

      The descriptors for this semantic link define the fluid collected or type of fluid balance. Different types of
      drainage are possible, e.g., from stomach, ventricles in brain (for reduction of intracranial pressure). The
      type or site of drainage must be defined separately. Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Blood
         —      Drainage
         —      Urine

      Additional descriptors are applicable, as follows:
         —      Crystalloid (fluid balance, which does not include blood infusion and blood drainage)
         —      Total (fluid balance of all fluids, including blood)

      A.7.6.5 Third set of differentiating criteria

      The fourth field holds the information about the context, i.e., the functional or organic system for which the
      term is relevant. In this case, all terms belong to fluids collected from the patient.

      A.7.6.5.1 Semantic link "pertains to:"

      There is only one descriptor:
         —      Fluid (collected from the patient, e.g., blood in drainage, urine output)

      A.7.6.6 Code table

       See Table A.7.6.1 for the nomenclature and codes for fluid-output measurements.

      A.7.7 Nomenclature, data dictionary, and codes for pumps

      A.7.7.1 Nomenclature for pump data

      Subclause A.7.7 presents a nomenclature for the systematic names for pump data. For better understanding,
      some examples of the use of pumps are described, and some remarks on applications are made.

      A.7.7.1.1 Examples of pump use in anesthesia and intensive care covered by this
      nomenclature

      Pumps are used in anesthesia and intensive care to deliver fluid and drugs to the patient in a controlled and
      easily manageable way. The pump guarantees a continuous flow, individually programmable and indepen-
      dent of level and pressure differences between fluid reservoir and patient’s body. The pump can be started
      and stopped and delivery rate changed on demand, thus allowing an individual profile for fluid delivery. In
      most cases, the fluid is only a means of bringing drugs to the patient’s body. In this case, the flow necessary
      is calculated from the concentration of drug in the fluid and the amount of drug to be delivered in a given
      time. There are different ways pumps are used. The examples in A.7.7.1.1.1 and A.7.7.1.1.2 describe which
      type of pump use is covered by this nomenclature.

      These examples do not explicitly distinguish manual pump control and data logging by computer on one
      side, from pump control and data logging by computer on the other side. Closed-loop control of the pump by
      computer applications and especially safety issues are not addressed explicitly as well. The intention of
      describing these examples is restricted to identification of data elements that have to be available in the
      nomenclature.

      A.7.7.1.1.1 Constant fluid rate and pump start/stop example

      The first example is a model in which the fluid rate (flow) is set and held constant for a certain time. After
      that time, the flow rate may change to a new value or the pump may be stopped. The fluid rate and the time
      of constant flow may be selected by pump panel or controlled by an application program inside the smart
      device or external to the computer. This model allows a computer to log complicated fluid- or drug-delivery
      profiles, either manually controlled or controlled by an application integrated in the pump, which is set up
      and started manually. If the pump is under computer control, bolus delivery and infusion profiles are con-
      trolled by changes of fluid rate after appropriate time increments and by starting and stopping the pump.
      Only a few simple data elements are necessary for logging fluid rate and events caused by changes in status,
      e.g., pump started, pump stopped. Setting fluid rate and changing pump status must be possible for control
      purposes.

      A manually controlled pump reports the delivery of a bolus, e.g., by reporting the continuous fluid rate, then
      a high flow rate for some time, and then the continuous flow rate again. An event is generated with every
      change of flow rate, as well as start and stop of the pump. The delivered volume is calculated by a data-log-
      ging application from the time elapsed between these events and the flow rate used in this interval. Applica-
      tion of a bolus may be controlled by a computer as well as by changing the flow rate to a new high value and
      changing the rate back to the former value after the time for delivery of the intended bolus volume has
      elapsed.

      This model can be enhanced by introducing the volume delivered by the pump. Pumps normally calculate
      the delivered volume themselves for direct display to the user and are able to report it. Some pumps are able
      to accumulate the volume delivered from several bottles or syringes successively. If the “Volume to be
      infused” setting is used, the pump stops automatically after that volume is infused. This setting can be used
      with manual setup or under computer control.

      The delivered dose of a drug may be calculated by the logging application from delivered volume and con-
      centration of drug in fluid. As an alternative, a pump-controlling application can calculate the volume to be

      infused and hence the fluid rate and time of delivery of that rate from drug concentration, drug amount to
      deliver, and drug rate desired by the user. There are pumps that handle these calculations themselves and are
      able also to calculate drug concentration in use from solvent volume and mass of drug added to it. In both
      instances, the data elements have to be entered manually. Data elements to communicate these values are
      included in the nomenclature.

      In principle all data-logging and many control applications can be covered by this example using only a few
      nomenclature elements.

      A.7.7.1.1.2 Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and bolus delivery example

      A second example knows two different states or rates in fluid delivery. Under normal conditions, the fluid
      and hence drug are delivered using a moderate (continuous) dose rate. This rate can be set directly or calcu-
      lated by the pump from drug concentration and desired drug delivery rate. A second state in flow exists. In
      PCA mode, e.g., used after operations for pain therapy to reduce the dose of analgesic drug to the lowest
      value acceptable by the patient, the patient has the possibility to demand a certain pre-set amount of drug by
      pressing a button if the pain becomes unacceptable for him or her. For safety reasons, the interval between
      these demands for bolus and the maximum amount of drug deliverable is also limited. For that reason, a
      demand for bolus may be accepted or rejected by the device. Good (accepted) demands and bad (not
      accepted) demands are reported as events, and the number of good demands and total demands may be
      counted and reported.

      Bolus is also used generally with syringe pumps. An anesthetist may choose a continuous fluid or drug
      delivery rate and pre-define parameters for a bolus, which he or she can apply under special conditions by
      conveniently pressing one button only. Application of such bolus is reported by an event and changes of
      flow rate, which is raised and reduced to the old value after some time. The Bolus data elements must be
      available in the nomenclature to be able to communicate the pre-set bolus parameters. In many cases the
      bolus flow rate is the highest flow rate available at the pump. In some cases the delivery rate of the drug
      must be limited using a certain setting of bolus fluid rate. To check the maximum flow rate deliverable by
      that pump, a nomenclature element must be available.

      A.7.7.1.1.3 Verification of identity of a physical and a logical pump

      In most cases, not only a single pump but many pumps are connected to a patient. The pumps may be con-
      nected to the computer logging the data or controlling the pumps by interface cables. The application pro-
      gram in the computer system is logically connected to the pumps and uses a certain logical name for a pump
      to handle the connection. The user inserts the syringe to a physical syringe pump. To be sure that the logical
      pump, handled in the application program and holding a certain drug, is identical to the physical pump, to
      which the user inserted the syringe, several possibilities exist. One possibility is to use disconnection and
      reconnection of the pump by the user to identify the pump. First, the user has to disconnect the interface
      cable from the pump; then the user has to insert the syringe; and then the user has to reconnect it. The appli-
      cation has to display disconnection and reconnection of a certain pump, and the user has to verify the corre-
      spondence of the physical and logical pump.

      Other possibilities use special elements in communication and/or control elements at the pump. If the pump
      has an alphanumeric display, which is accessible by the computer, the computer can write the proposed
      name of the drug to the display of a logical pump. This name can be displayed at the physical pump, and the
      user can verify that the pump is the same pump in which he or she inserted or intended to insert the syringe
      with that drug. Verification may be negotiated directly with the application or by pressing a button on the
      device, generating an event passed to the application. In this case, the application can be sure that the user
      sends his or her response directly from the logical and physical device to be identified.

      The user may also choose the name of the drug directly from a list in the pump. The drug name is directly
      visible on the pump's display and is communicated to the application program.

      Another possibility is the integration of a bar-code reader into the pump. Such a reader allows the user to
      directly read the identification of the drug from the syringe or bottle. This method is most convenient for the
      user, who adheres a bar-code label onto the bottle or syringe. The pump can then directly read the identifica-
      tion of the drug and communicate it to the application.

      In any case, data elements for drug identification are necessary.

      A.7.7.1.2 Examples not intended to be covered by this version of the nomenclature

      There are many special profiles for the delivery of drugs and hence many fluid delivery rates are possible.
      Several profiles will be implemented in smart pumps. Reporting the flow rates caused by these profiles is
      not a big problem, if the pump reports every change in delivery rate. The application can follow the profile
      by incremental calculation of delivered volume from delivery rate and duration of delivery for that incre-
      mental step. This version of the nomenclature is not intended to include elements for computer-controlled
      setup of such profiles in pumps.

      A.7.7.2 Base concepts

      The base concepts are more or less physical properties. The following descriptors are applicable:
         —      Concentration (the concentrations of drugs in a solvent)
         —      Duration (time intervals, e.g., application of drugs)
         —      Flow (the fluid volume delivered in a time unit to the patient; also used in the sense of flow of mass,
                describing the mass of drug delivered in a time unit to the patient by the fluid)
                NOTE—Flow is used instead of Rate, which is used as a common term and familiar to medical users. Rate is
                used in this standard for frequency of events. However, Rate would be possible in this context for rates of
                drops.
         —      Mass (the mass of a drug dissolved in the fluid delivered to the patient)
         —      Mode (the operational mode of the pump (an enumeration observation element; see A.7.7.7)
         —      Number (used for counts, in this case, of boli of analgesic drugs in PCA)
         —      Rate (the frequency of occurrence of events, etc., based on a certain time frame: second, minute,
                hour, etc.)
         —      Pressure (necessary to deliver fluid to patient; shows impediment in patient line)
         —      Status (the operational state of the pump (an enumeration observation element; see A.7.7.13)
         —      Substance (the drug delivered to patient described by its generic name or brand)
         —      Type (used for the definition of syringe, infusion tubing, etc., annotations)
         —      Volume (all types of volumes of fluids and sizes of syringes)

      A.7.7.3 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field of the systematic name refers to the measurement features. Three semantic links are
      applied to the first set of differentiating criteria. More than one semantic link and one descriptor are possible.

      A.7.7.3.1 Semantic link "has specification:"

      Descriptors for the demands of the patient for analgesic drug accepted by the pump in PCA are as follows.
      Total demand is the sum of accepted and rejected demands.
         —      AcceptedDemand
         —      GoodDemand
         —      Requests
         —      TotalDemand

      Descriptors, i.e., actual measurement or setting, for the flow, volume, etc., that the pump delivers to the
      patient are as follows:
         —      Delivered
         —      Delivery

      Descriptors for the technical specifications of flow or volumes that a pump can deliver and for the selected
      range, if more than one is possible, are as follows:
         —      Maximum
         —      Minimum
         —      Range
         —      Resolution

      Descriptors for the total volume applied to the patient are as follows:
         —      Total
         —      TotalDelivery

      Additional applicable descriptors are as follows:

         —      BSA (a measure of body surface area to which a dosage is normalized)
         —      Delay (the time after which the pump enters Infusing state from Stand By state)
         —      Diluent (the solvent to which the drug(s) are added, if a mixture is infused to the patient. The diluent
                may be a solution itself, e.g., a solution of protein or NaCl. The diluent should be standardized in
                concentration and commercially available.)
         —      Doses (the single doses given in a multidose mode)
         —      DrugName (name of the solution or drug applied by the pump to the patient)
         —      Interdoses (the time interval between bolus dosing)
         —      Loading (the mass of a drug added to the solvent before loading the pump; used for drug concentra-
                tion calculation)
         —      Mass (specifies that the flow describes the mass of a drug dissolved in the fluid and delivered to the
                patient in a time unit)
         —      Normalized (i.e., the doses of a drug or amount of liquid is normalized to the patient’s body surface
                area)
         —      Operational (the operation mode of the device itself)
         —      Proposed (the name of the product proposed for infusion, as proposed by application. In most cases,
                several pumps are in use at the same patient. A certain pump may be selected for application of a
                specific drug by an application program. The application may transmit the drug name, for example,
                to the selected pump. The nurse inserts the syringe with the drug to the pump, which shows the pro-
                posed name and has to confirm the assignment.)
         —      Remaining (portion of fluid to be infused, left after some time from the whole volume to be infused)
         —      Size (the size of a syringe)
         —      TBI (to be infused, e.g., volume that shall be given to the patient)

      A.7.7.3.2 Semantic link "has method:"

      Descriptors used in this case to distinguish pressure directly measured by sensor from pressure indirectly
      calculated from motor current are as follows:

         —      Measured


       Additional descriptors are as follows:

         —      Standby (when a pump is connected to patient and ready to use; no flow is delivered to patient)


      A.7.7.4 Second set of differentiating criteria


      The third field of the systematic name describes the target of measurement. In this case, parts of the pumping
      system are possible as well as the fluid and drug applied to the patient.

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:

         —      Device

         —      Drug (therapeutic active part in the fluid applied to the patient)

         —      Fluid (the fluid itself applied to the patient, mostly including the drug)

         —      Syringe (a part of a syringe pump, carrying fluid and drug, and the active part of the pump, i.e., pis-
                ton)

         —      Tube (the tube bringing fluid from the fluid reservoir to the patient. The type of tubing, diameter,
                and elasticity are important for the flow reached for a certain velocity of the pump, e.g., in peristaltic
                infusion pumps.)


      A.7.7.5 Third set of differentiating criteria


      The fourth field holds the information about the context, i.e., the functional or organic system for which the
      term is relevant. In this case, all terms belong to pumps used for therapeutical reasons.


      A.7.7.5.1 Semantic link "pertains to:"


      There is only one descriptor:

      A.7.7.7 Specification of pump modes

      Different types of pumps exist, and some pumps can be used in different modes. The enumeration observa-
      tion element Mode | | Device | Pump in Table A.7.7.1 can communicate a value of type Bit String denoting
      the pump mode in use. Table A.7.7.2 defines these values for the different pump modes.

      A.7.7.8 Base concept

      The base concept is as follows:
         —       Mode

      A.7.7.9 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field in the systematic name refers to measurement features.

      A.7.7.9.1 Semantic link "has specification:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Bolus
         —      Circadian
         —      ClosedLoop
         —      Delayed
         —      DrugDosing
         —      ManufacturerDefined
         —      MultiChannel
         —      MultiDosing
         —      MultiStep
         —      Nominal
         —      PCA
         —      RampAndTaper
         —      Titration

      A.7.7.10 Second set of differentiating criteria

      The third field in the systematic name describes the target of measurement. The device itself or its function-
      ality is described.

      A.7.7.10.1 Semantic link "concerns:"

      Applicable is one descriptor only:
         —      Device

      A.7.7.11 Third set of differentiating criteria

      The fourth field holds information about the context. In this case, it is information about the working mode
      of the pump itself.

      A.7.7.13 Specification of pump states

      Pumps know some specific device states, different from most other devices. For that reason, the enumera-
      tion observation element Status | Operational | Device | Pump is introduced in Table A.7.7.1, which commu-
      nicates in a value the status information about the pump. Table A.7.7.3 defines the states and the bit string
      values.

      A.7.7.14 Base concept

      The base concept is as follows:
         —      Status

      A.7.7.15 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field in the systematic name refers to measurement features.

      A.7.7.15.1 Semantic link "has specification:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      AcceptedDemand
         —      BolusDelivering
         —      Infusing
         —      KVO
         —      PCA
         —      RejectedDemand
         —      RumpUp
         —      TaperDown

      A.7.7.16 Second set of differentiating criteria

      The third field in the systematic name describes the target of measurement. Different operational states of
      the pumps are described.

      A.7.7.16.1 Semantic link "concerns:"

      Applicable is one descriptor only:
         —      OperationalStatus

      A.7.7.17 Third set of differentiating criteria

      The fourth field holds information about the context. In this case, it is information about the operational state
      of the pump itself.

      A.7.7.17.1 Semantic link "has context:"

      The following descriptor is applicable:
         —      Pump

      A.7.7.18 Bit string table

      See Table A.7.7.3 for the bit string values for pump states.

      The base concepts are physical properties. The following descriptors are applicable:
         —      Circumference (a length measurement)
         —      Compliance ( the elastic properties of the brain and especially the capacity to deal with an uptake of
                fluid, e.g., during systolic phase or by a swelling of the brain with only small changes in pressure)
         —      Diameter (a length measurement)
         —      Duration (a time measurement used for interpeak intervals and reaction time)
         —      ElectricalPotential (electrical signals recorded on body surface or directly in tissue or fluids; used
                for all recordings like EEG, evoked potentials, etc., and derived amplitude measurements)
         —      Flow (the velocity of the fluid exchange; used for blood flow measurement in brain vessels, etc.)
         —      Frequency (used for derived values calculated from EEG-power-spectra)
         —      Latency (a time measurement used for events following a stimulus after a certain time, typically in
                the recording of evoked potentials)
         —      MagneticField (measurements of magnetic fields due to currents, e.g., in the brain)
         —      Number (used for counted events, e.g., arousals in sleep-EEG or specific events in epilepsy
                diagnosis)
         —      Power (calculated values, e.g., from EEG using the fast Fourier transform [FFT])
         —      Pressure (in fluids, tissue, etc.; used for measurements of intracranial pressure)
         —      Score (used for the Glasgow coma score and sleep stage; values used for describing the neurologic
                situation of the patient)

      A.7.8.3 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field of systematic name in Table A.7.8.1 refers to the measurement features. Four semantic
      links are applied to build the first differentiating criterion.

      A.7.8.4 Second set of differentiating criteria

      The third field of systematic name in Table A.7.8.1 describes the target of measurement. More than one
      descriptor is possible. It holds information about body compartments, body parts, or body functions or refers
      to their state.

      Additional descriptors are as follows:
         —      Arousal (short awakening of a patient, in sleep laboratory recognized from EEG)
         —      CNS State (used for terms that describe the state of the functional CNS in general or a state of the

      A.7.8.5 Third set of differentiating criteria

      The fourth field holds information about the context, i.e., the functional or organic system for which the term
      is relevant. Most terms in Table A.7.8.1 belong to the CNS. The muscular system is included because elec-
      tromyogram (EMG) measurements are performed by neurologists as well. The terms may belong to more
      than one table. Circumference of the head (Circum Head), as an example, is used not only in neurology (e.g.,
      in connection with the measurement of intracranial pressure for hydrocephalus diagnostic), but also as a
      general measure to characterize the body (e.g., in connection with pediatrics, especially the monitoring of
      the growth of the skull).

      A.7.8.5.1 Semantic link "has context:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Body (i.e., parts of the body)
         —      CNS
         —      MuscularSystem (the muscular parts of the body)
         —      Neurology (the entire field of neurology)

      A.7.9 Nomenclature,                      data        dictionary,           and       codes          for      neurophysiologic
      enumerations

      A.7.9.1 Introduction

      Subclause A.7.9 presents a nomenclature for systematic names for enumeration in neurophysiologic moni-
      toring. The systematic names are grouped in several tables (see Table A.7.9.1, Table A.7.10.1,
      Table A.8.2.1, and Table A.8.3.1). Table A.7.9.1 lists systematic names concerning neurophysiologic pat-
      terns, derived from EEG, EMG, etc., signals by a neurophysiologic measurement system or by a physician
      who marks his or her diagnostics during visual inspection of the signal. This nomenclature holds basic pat-
      terns only to describe the waveforms. The physician often has to qualify the patterns (e.g., frequency, ampli-
      tude) by a grading system. That system is not included in this nomenclature because a system for that
      purpose is available from ASTM.

      A.7.9.2 Base concept

      In this special case, only one descriptor is applicable:
         —      Pattern (the pattern recognized in a measurement)

      A.7.9.3 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field of the systematic name refers to the measurement features.

      A.7.10 Nomenclature, data dictionary, and codes for stimulation modes

      A.7.10.1 Introduction

      Subclause A.7.10 presents a nomenclature for enumeration of stimulator devices used in neurophysiologic
      monitoring of evoked potentials and EMG measurements. A stimulus for acoustic evoked potential, for
      example, is described by the stimulus type, e.g., Click; the initial pressure change, e.g., Rarefaction; and the
      ear to which the stimulus is presented, e.g., LeftEar. A masking noise is presented to the contralateral ear
      normally. In most cases, four parameters are necessary to describe a visual stimulus. They are visual stimu-
      lus type, e.g., PatternReversal; pattern type, e.g., Checkerboard; visual field, e.g., Half; and eye to which the
      stimulus is presented, e.g., LeftEye.

      A.7.10.2 Base concepts

      Two base concepts are applicable:
         —      Side (the side, e.g., ear or eye, to which a stimulus is applied)
         —      Type (the type of stimulus used in a measurement)

      A.7.10.3 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field of the systematic name refers to the measurement features.

      A.7.10.3.1 Semantic link "concerns:"

      Applicable descriptors include the following:
         —      MaskingNoise
         —      Pattern
         —      Stimulus
         —      VisualField

      Descriptors for the sensory organ to which the stimulus is presented are as follows:
         —      BothEars
         —      BothEyes
         —      LeftEar
         —      LeftEye
         —      RightEar
         —      RightEye

      A.7.10.3.2 Semantic link "has acoustic stimulus type:"

      Descriptors for the type of acoustic stimulus are as follows:
         —      Click
         —      FilteredClick
         —      GatedSine
         —      Pip

      A.7.10.3.3 Semantic link "has pressure type:"

      Descriptors for the initial change in pressure in an acoustic stimulus are as follows:
         —      Alternating
         —      Condensation
         —      Rarefaction

      Descriptors for the change of intensity of the stimulus are as follows:
         —      Flash
         —      PatternReversal
         —      Sinusoidally

      A.7.10.3.5 Semantic link "has visual pattern type:"

      Descriptors for the type of pattern used for visual stimulation are as follows:
         —      Bar
         —      CheckerBoard
         —      Complex
         —      DartBoard
         —      SineWave
         —      Windmill

      Descriptors for how much of the visual field is influenced by the stimulus are as follows:
         —      Full
         —      Half
         —      Quadrant

      A.7.10.3.7 Semantic link "has direction:"

      Descriptors for the orientation of the stimulating pattern are as follows:
         —      Horizontally

      A.7.11 Nomenclature, data dictionary, and codes for miscellaneous measurements

      A.7.11.1 Introduction

      Subclause A.7.11 presents a nomenclature for miscellaneous medical terms in vital signs monitoring. The
      purpose of this nomenclature is to support unique identification of medical data in communication. The
      terms are used in the Metric object of the DIM to identify the actual data.

      A.7.11.2 Base concepts

      Physical properties are used as base concepts. There is also a relation to the vital signs devices nomenclature
      (see Table A.5.1) where “Measures or affects physical property” is the second semantic link. The following
      base concepts are used:
         —      Area
         —      Ballistocardiogram
         —      Concentration
         —      ElectricalPotential
         —      Flow
         —      Length
         —      MagneticField
         —      Mass
         —      Pressure
         —      Temperature
         —      Tocogram

      A.7.11.3 First set of differentiating criteria

      This field holds the measurement features. More than one descriptor is possible. They specify the
      measurement.

      A.7.11.3.1 Semantic link "is computed as:"

      Descriptors for the value calculated from different temperature measurements are as follows:
         —      Difference
         —      Mean

      A.7.11.3.2 Semantic link "pertains:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Acid

      A.7.11.3.3 Semantic link "has origin:"

      Descriptors for the type of filtered signal derived from balistographic measurement are as follows:
         —      Breathing
         —      Cardiaccycle
         —      Movement

     PART 10101: NOMENCLATURE                                                                              ISO/IEEE 11073-10101:2004(E)


      The descriptor for specifying the channel of magnetic field measurement, which is manufacturer-specific, is
      as follows:
         —      Site

      A.7.11.3.4 Semantic link "has specification:"

      The descriptor to define a value is an actual measurement or computation (e.g., patient mass, patient high,
      BSA) is as follows:
         —      Actual

      A.7.11.4 Second set of differentiating criteria

      This field describes the target of measurement. More than one descriptor is possible. It holds information
      about body compartments, body parts, or body functions.

      A.7.11.4.1 Semantic link "concerns:"

      The following descriptors exist:
         —      Blood
         —      BodySurface (the area of patient body surface)
         —      Core (a site of temperature measurements)
         —      Ear
         —      Esophagus
         —      Finger
         —      Gastric
         —      Oral (the target from a compartment or body part view)
         —      PeripheralVessels
         —      Rectal (the target from a compartment or body part view)
         —      Surface (a site of temperature measurements)
         —      Toe

      A.7.11.5 Third set of differentiating criteria

      A.8 Nomenclature, data dictionary, and codes for body sites (Block D)

      A.8.1 Introduction

      Clause A.8 contains nomenclature for body sites. Sites are grouped in to different tables. The lists in the
      tables include sites that are commonly used, but are not exhaustive. SNOMED coding is shown for reference
      and convenience except in Table A.8.4.1, which refers to the international 10–20 system, and Table A.8.5.1
      for EOG sites. Individual codes may be used for sites other than the sites listed. Cross-referencing to
      SNOMED is advocated.

      Table A.8.5.1 relating to electrode placement for EOG signal monitoring is accompanied by a short explan-
      atory section (A.8.5.1.1) as no standard site descriptions are available for this topic.

      The process for building the systematic name was somewhat different from the process usually used, espe-
      cially for Table A.8.2.1 and Table A.8.3.1, relating to the sites near peripheral nerves and to the sites near or
      in muscles, respectively. Usually a description/definition is necessary to choose the descriptors for the sys-
      tematic name. To find correct and unequivocal anatomical definitions is very difficult in this area. Interna-
      tionally accepted terms are published in Nomina Anatomica [B19], approved by the International Congress
      of Anatomists at Mexico City, 1980. These terms are in Latin and accepted by physicians worldwide. These
      terms are included in the description/definition. They are in use in non-English-speaking countries. The sys-
      tematic name is based on this Latin name, and the parts of this name are used as descriptors in the first dif-
      ferentiating criteria. The English term is also given in brackets [ ] in the description/definition, as well as the
      SNOMED code. See the following example:

      Example:

      The laterality, left or right, is expressed in many cases by a separate code in SNOMED. In the systematic
      name, laterality is included as an descriptor in the first set of differentiating criteria.


      A.8.2 Sites for neurophysiological signal monitoring: locations near peripheral
      nerves

      In this special case, only one descriptor is applicable:
         —      Muscle (the position or object of a measurement)

      A.8.3.2 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field of the systematic name refers to the measurement features. In this case, the descriptors are
      the parts of the Latin name in Nomina Anatomica. The following semantic links are applied to the first set of
      differentiating criteria. It is possible to have more than one semantic link and/or descriptor.

      A.8.3.2.1 Semantic link "relates to anatomic structure:"

      A.8.4 Sites for EEG-electrode placement on the head

      A.8.4.1 Introduction

      Subclause A.8.4 holds nomenclature for electrode positions in EEG measurements. The electrode placement
      is specified according to the well known and internationally accepted 10–20 system. The electrode positions
      are defined using two arcs over anatomically well-defined lines:
         —      The line between nasion and inion. Along this arc, the areas such as frontal, central, parietal, tempo-
                ral, etc., are defined.
         —      The line between left ear and right ear. Along this arc, the positions are numbered: odd numbers
                describe positions on the left hemisphere; even numbers, right hemisphere. The letter z, e.g., in Pz,
                denotes medial positions, straight over the line between nasion and inion.

      A.8.4.2 Base concept

      In this special case, only one descriptor is applicable:
         —      Head (an electrode position on the head, especially according to 10–20 system)

      A.8.4.3 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field of the systematic name refers to the position of the electrode on the skull. It is possible to
      have more than one semantic link and/or descriptor.

      A.8.4.3.1 Semantic link "belongs to area along line from nasion to inion:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Anterior
         —      Central
         —      Frontal
         —      Occipital
         —      Parietal
         —      Polar

      A.8.4.3.2 Semantic link "belongs to lateral head:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Sphenoidal
         —      Temporal

      A.8.4.3.3 Semantic link "belongs to neck:"

      The descriptor is as follows:
         —      Pharyngeal

      A.8.4.3.4 Semantic link "has position on left hemisphere:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      1
         —      3
         —      5

         —      7
         —      9

      A.8.4.3.5 Semantic link "has position on right hemisphere:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      2
         —      4
         —      6
         —      8
         —      10

      A.8.4.3.6 Semantic link "belongs to hemisphere:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Left
         —      Right

      A.8.4.3.7 Semantic link "belongs to parasagital region:"

      The descriptor is as follows:
         —      Midline

      A.8.4.3.8 Semantic link "is anatomically positioned at:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Ear
         —      Inion
         —      Nasion

      A.8.4.4 Second set of differentiating criteria

      The third field of the systematic name describes the target of measurement.

      A.8.4.4.1 Semantic link "concerns:"

      No descriptor is applicable.

      A.8.4.5 Third set of differentiating criteria

      The fourth field holds the information about the context, i.e., the functional or organ system for which the
      term is relevant.

      A.8.4.5.1 Semantic link "pertains to:"

      Only one descriptor exists:
         —      CNS

      A.8.5 Sites for EOG signal monitoring

      A.8.5.1 Introduction

      Subclause A.8.5 presents a nomenclature for sites for EOG electrodes used mostly in neurophysiological
      monitoring. The list of electrode positions is necessary for the specification of other monitoring devices. The
      purpose of this nomenclature is to support unique identification of medical data in communication. The
      terms are used in the Metric object of the DIM to identify the actual data. The terms were extracted from dif-
      ferent sources because there appears to be no previous applicable nomenclature for this purpose. Although
      the intention is not to standardize medicine, such standardization may result when the nomenclature is pub-
      lished.

      A.8.5.1.1 Graphic representation of the EOG electrode positions

      Because the suggested nomenclature includes electrode sites that are not necessarily commonly known, it is
      necessary to present the positions in graphical form in addition to textual description of the positions. See
      Figure A.8.5.1.

                        Figure A.8.5.1—Schematic diagram of the EOG electrode positions


      The electrode between the eyes has been coded E0. The electrodes of the right eye have been coded with
      Erx, where E means eye, r means right, and x is a number between 1 and 7. In principle the odd numbers
      mean electrodes above the eye and the even numbers mean electrodes below the eye. The exception is elec-
      trode Er7, which is directly on the horizontal axis of the eyes. Correspondingly, the electrodes for the left
      eye have been coded with Elx, where E means eye, l means left, and the number x describes the position in
      more detail. The electrode positions in the left eye are a mirror image of the positions of the right eye. The
      electrodes below the eyes are slightly nearer the eyes due to the physiology of the eyes, the eyelids, and the
      eyebrows.

      It is also possible to place an electrode or a mechanical eye movement sensor on the eyelid. For these pur-
      poses, the list includes two entries: ErL for the right eyelid and ElL for the left eyelid.

      If a different electrode placement is chosen, the codes shown in Figure A.8.5.1 are not used. In this case, the
      code is formed as follows: if the electrode is near the left eye, the code begins with El; and if it is nearer the
      right eye, the code begins with Er. If the electrode is above the horizontal axis of the eyes, the letter a is
      added to the code; and if it is below the horizontal axis, the letter b is added to the code. In medical studies,
      not all the above electrodes are used in a single measurement. However, the physician chooses the electrodes
      that appear most relevant and references the electrodes either to the positions in Table A.8.5.1 for EOG elec-
      trodes or to the positions given in Table A.8.4.1 for EEG electrodes.

      A.8.5.1.2 Fields in the table

      Table A.8.5.1 lists the codes for EOG electrode positions. See Häkkinen et al. [B8] for discussion of many
      of these electrode positions.

      A.8.5.2 Base concept

      In this special case, only one descriptor is applicable:
         —      Eye (the object or position of a measurement)

      A.8.5.3 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field of the systematic name refers to the measurement features. It is possible to have more than
      one semantic link and or descriptor.

      A.8.5.3.1 Semantic link "is near to anatomical structure:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Canthus
         —      CanthusLateralis
         —      Eyelid

      A.8.5.3.2 Semantic link "has position:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Above
         —      Below
         —      Between
         —      Center
         —      HorizontalAxis
         —      Left
         —      Outer
         —      Right

      A.8.5.4 Second set of differentiating criteria

      The third field of the systematic name describes the target of measurement.

      A.8.5.4.1 Semantic link "concerns:"

      The descriptor is as follows:
         —      Head

      A.8.5.5 Third set of differentiating criteria

      The fourth field holds the information about the context, i.e., the functional or organ system for which the
      term is relevant.

      A.8.6 Sites for general neurological monitoring measurements and drainage

      A.8.6.1 Base concept

      In this special case, only one descriptor is applicable:
         —      Brain (the object or position of a measurement)

      A.8.6.2 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field of the systematic name refers to the measurement features. It is possible to have more than
      one semantic link and or descriptor.

      A.8.6.2.1 Semantic link "has position:"

      Applicable descriptors include the following:
         —      Epidural
         —      Intraparenchymal
         —      Intraventricular
         —      Subarachnoidal
         —      Subdural

      Descriptors for laterality are as follows:
         —      Left
         —      Right

      A.8.6.3 Second set of differentiating criteria

      The third field of the systematic name describes the target of measurement.

      A.8.6.3.1 Semantic link "concerns:"

      The descriptor is as follows:
         —      IntracranialPressure

      A.8.6.4 Third set of differentiating criteria

      The fourth field holds the information about the context, i.e., the functional or organ system, for which the
      term is relevant.

      A.8.6.4.1 Semantic link "pertains to:"

      There is only one descriptor:
         —      Body

      A.8.6.5 Code table

      See Table A.8.6.1 for the nomenclature and codes for general neurological sites for monitoring measure-
      ments and drainage.

      A.8.7 Sites for cardiovascular measurements

      A.8.7.1 Base concepts

      The following descriptors for the position of a measurement are applicable:
         —      Artery
         —      Heart
         —      Vein

      A.8.7.2 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field of the systematic name refers to the measurement features. It is possible to have more than
      one semantic link and or one descriptor.

      A.8.7.2.1 Semantic link "relates to substructure:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Atrium
         —      Ventricle

      A.8.7.2.2 Semantic link "relates to vessel:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Axillaris
         —      Brachialis
         —      Cerebri
         —      Conus
         —      CoronaryArtery
         —      Dorsalis
         —      Femoralis
         —      Jugularis
         —      Media
         —      Profunda
         —      Pulmonalis
         —      Radialis
         —      Subclavia
         —      Temporalis
         —      Ulnaris
         —      Umbilicalis

      A.8.7.2.3 Semantic link "has position:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Externa
         —      Interna
         —      Left
         —      Right

      A.8.7.2.4 Semantic link "specifies branch:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      AnteriorDescendingBranch
         —      CircumflexBranch
         —      MarginalBranch
         —      PosteriorDescendingBranch

      A.8.7.3 Second set of differentiating criteria

      The third field of the systematic name describes the target of measurement.

      A.8.7.3.1 Semantic link "concerns:"

      Only one descriptor is applicable:
         —      CVS

      A.8.7.4 Third set of differentiating criteria

      The fourth field holds the information about the context, i.e., the functional or organic system for which the
      term is relevant.

      A.8.7.4.1 Semantic link "pertains to:"

      There is only one descriptor applicable:
         —      Body

      A.8.7.5 Code table

      See Table A.8.7.1 for the nomenclature and codes for body sites for cardiovascular measurements.

      A.8.8 Miscellaneous sites used in vital signs monitoring and measurement

      A.8.8.1 Base concepts

      The base concepts are supposed to describe the object or position of a measurement. Applicable descriptors
      are as follows:
         —      Head
         —      LowerExtremity
         —      Trunk
         —      UpperExtremity
         —      Vein

      A.8.8.2 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field of the systematic name refers to the measurement features. It is possible to have more than
      one semantic link and or one descriptor.

      A.8.8.2.1 Semantic link "pertains to:"

      Descriptors for drainage and fluid output measurements are as follows:
         —      AbdominalCavity
         —      Bladder
         —      ChestWall
         —      Head
         —      Neck
         —      Pelvis
         —      Pleura
         —      Ureter

      Descriptors for fluid therapy are as follows:
         —      Cava
         —      HandBack
         —      Umbilicalis

      A.8.8.2.2 Semantic link "is positioned:"

      Descriptors for subspecification of an area are as follows:
         —      Apical
         —      Basal
         —      Inferior
         —      IntraOssery
         —      Left
         —      Peripheral
         —      Right
         —      Superior

      A.8.9 Qualifiers of body site locations

      A.8.9.1 Introduction

      Subclause A.8.9 holds nomenclature for more precise specification of body sites. Items included in
      Table A.8.9.1 can be used in the attribute Body-Site-List in the Metric object of the DIM. These items are
      used alone in this attribute, in case the body site location is specified in the measurement item itself, e.g.,
      Pressure | Systolic | Blood | LeftVentricle | CVS. The attribute Body-Site-List in the Metric object can also
      be filled by a body site location and a body site qualifier, if the location is not specified in the measurement
      itself.

      A.8.9.2 Base concept

      One base concept is applicable:
         —      Qualifier

      A.8.9.3 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field of systematic name refers to the measurement features.

      A.8.9.3.1 Semantic link "has relative position:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Anterior
         —      Bilateral
         —      Deep
         —      Distal
         —      Inferior
         —      Intermediate
         —      Medial
         —      Midline
         —      Lateral
         —      Left
         —      Posterior
         —      Proximal
         —      Right
         —      Superficial
         —      Superior

      A.8.9.3.2 Semantic link: "describes portion of muscle:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      Belly
         —      Insertion

      A.8.9.3.3 Semantic link "describes portion of nerve:"

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      CNS_Connection

      A.9 Nomenclature, data dictionary, and codes for alerts (Block E)

      A.9.1 Introduction

      Clause A.9 presents a nomenclature for systematic names for events in physiologic monitoring. Every item
      in the event tables (i.e., Table A.9.2.1 and Table A.9.3.1) is an event that may become an alert. In both cases
      (i.e., event or alert), the occurrence is handled by one of the objects in the Alert Package of the DIM,
      depending on the implementation. The systematic names are grouped in two tables:
         —      Table A.9.2.1 holds systematic names concerning patient-oriented events that are derived from
                physiologic signals, e.g., ECG, EEG. These events are triggered if specific diagnostic patterns are
                observed in the physiologic signal. These events are called PatternEvent. (See A.9.2.)
         —      Table A.9.3.1 holds systematic names concerning events that are more device-orientated. These
                events are fired if an error condition occurs in a device itself, in its environment, or in the resulting
                data. These events are called ErrorEvent or LimitEvent (if a limit is hurt). Another type of event,
                SychronizationEvent, is used for synchronizing devices or processes. Yet another type of event,
                Advisory, is used for warnings and instructions to the user, e.g., "calibration necessary." (See
                A.9.3.)


      A.9.2 Diagnostic pattern events

      A.9.2.1 Base concepts

      The following base concepts describe the condition in a measurement leading to an event:

         —      PatternEvent

      A.9.2.2 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field of the systematic name refers to the measurement features.

      A.10 Nomenclature, data dictionary, and codes for external nomenclatures
      and messaging standards (Block F)

      A.10.1 Introduction

      Diagnostics and procedures are not included in the scope of this standard and hence in the nomenclature in
      Annex A. On the other hand, such information may be necessary, especially in an archival scenario. In the
      Patient Package in the DIM, provision is made for using external nomenclature for diagnostic and proce-
      dural codes. Table A.10.1 defines codes for definition of such external references. It is a arbitrary list to be
      updated if necessary. The systematic name is for similarity to other tables only. A classification of the
      nomenclatures is not intended.


      A.10.2 Base concepts

      The base concept defines the type of the information, here a term in an external nomenclature:
         —      Term


      A.10.3 First set of differentiating criteria

      The second field of the systematic name refers in general to the measurement features. The name of the
      nomenclature is used as a descriptor in this field in most cases.

      A.10.3.1 Semantic link "has specification: "

      Applicable descriptors are as follows:
         —      ARDEN
         —      ASTM_E1238
         —      ASTM_E1394-91
         —      ASTM_E1467-94
         —      CPT
         —      DRG
         —      DSM-IIIR
         —      GALEN
         —      GRAIL
         —      HL7
         —      ICD-9
         —      ICD-10
         —      ICPM
         —      ICPM-GE
         —      LOINC
         —      MeSH
         —      Minnesota
         —      NANDA
         —      NIC
         —      NNN
         —      NOC

         —      VESKA


      A.10.4 Second set of differentiating criteria

      The third field of the systematic name describes in general the target of measurement, here an area for which
      the external nomenclature is used.

      A.10.4.1 Semantic link "concerns:"

      More than one descriptor is possible, as follows:
         —      ClinicalInstruments
         —      ClinicalObservations
         —      Diagnoses
         —      ECG
         —      Inventions
         —      MentalDisorders
         —      Nursing
         —      Outcome
         —      Procedures
         —      RelatedGroups


      A.10.5 Third set of differentiating criteria

      The fourth field in the systematic name holds information about the context. In this case, the term specifies
      an external nomenclature.

      A.10.5.1 Semantic link "has context:"

      Only one descriptor is applicable:
         —      ExternalNomenclature


      A.10.6 Code table

      See Table A.10.1 for the nomenclature and codes for external nomenclatures and messaging standards.

      Annex B
      (normative)

      Nomenclature syntax

      B.1 General

      Codes in this annex that correspond with the codes defined in Annex A take on the semantic of that annex.
      Semantics of other codes are reserved to this annex.

      Syntax defined in this annex shall not be normative unless a semantic corollary is specified in this standard.
      However, terms in this annex may be reorganized for presentation, e.g., into sequential code order, as appro-
      priate to facilitate application programming.


      B.1.1 Notation

      Listing entries are of the following form:


      #define MDC_term                                                                c        /*Mm                              a         */


      where
         #define                        is the programming language symbol for a constant definition;
         #define MDC_term               is the nomenclature symbol, or title;
         c                              is the decimal number code, which is in the range 0–65 535
                                            (i.e., 2**16–1); this code is communicated in PDUs in the appropriate encod-
                                            ing form, e.g., MDDL-OID, an INT-U16;
         Mm                             is the master record number in the MDDL nomenclature database;
                                            this code is immutable (i.e., does not change over time, although other compo-
                                            nents of the term may); and
         a                              is an acronym; this field may be blank.

      The last components are enclosed in the syntax /*                     */, which represents a comment.


      B.1.2 Partition codes

      This subclause lists partition (or code block) codes. Partition codes may be considered to be unique as the
      high-order 16 bits of a 32-bit integer code.

      /* CodeBlock Definitions                                                                                                             */

      #define MDC_PART_UNSPEC                                                         0        /*     Unspecified                          */

      #define MDC_PART_OBJ                                                            1        /*     Object Infrastr.                     */

      #define MDC_PART_SCADA                                                          2        /*     SCADA(Physio IDs)                    */

      B.1.3 Discriminator ranges

      This subclause lists discriminator range codes. Discriminators are organized so that codes for homologous
      discriminators are all located within the range specified. In this listing, the Discrim Offset indicates the com-
      mon denominator of the discriminator (i.e., the numerical difference between discriminator codes), which in
      binary amounts to log2(DiscrimOffset); e.g., ECG Lead discriminator is log2(256)=8 bits).
